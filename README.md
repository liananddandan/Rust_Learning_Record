# 01 - Get Started: Hello, World!

This is the first Rust program, demonstrating the use of the `println!` macro to output text to the terminal.

## Cargo Commands

```bash
# Compile the project
cargo build

# Run the compiled binary
cargo run

# Check code for errors without building
cargo check

# Clean up target directory
cargo clean
```


# 02 - Programming a Guessing Game

This project implements a simple number guessing game in Rust.

## How it works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user types guesses into the terminal.
- The program tells the user whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- The game continues until the user guesses correctly.

## How to Run

```bash
cargo run
```
